# 👋 Hey, I'm Brendan Lucas

> "Strong. Smart. And just getting started."

I'm a young developer, systems thinker, and language designer working on tools that challenge how we think about programming, file formats, and automation. I believe software should be **lightweight**, **transparent**, and **scalable**—and that most modern stacks are way too bloated for what they do.

## What I'm Building

### Z# – The Low-Level, High-Power Language
Z# is my from-scratch programming language that blends system-level control with modern syntax.  
Think TypeScript meets Assembly, but with:
- **User-defined types as first-class citizens**
- **Quads as the base data unit (`byte`)**
- **No runtime—compile directly to native binaries via `.iz` files**
- A modular feature system, so only what you need gets compiled

[Documentation](https://docs.zsharp.dev) · `zs emit` for bare-metal builds.

### SV3D – Scalable Vector 3D Format
I'm redefining 3D asset pipelines with SV3D:
- Infinite precision vector shapes rendered at runtime
- ~1000x smaller files than traditional formats
- Optimized for games and real-time environments
- Dynamic texturing with SVG-like patterns

### Renderlabs Studio (Rewriting in Z#)
A 3D editor and animation toolkit using SV3D.  
Being rebuilt in Z# to maximize performance and push boundaries in how 3D assets are created and compiled.

### Subvertia – Automation That Fights Back
Subvertia is a browser-based school automation tool that:
- Bypasses slow workflows
- Uses stealth, AI, and headless logic

Targeted at students, open-source soon. (*Not* your average homework helper.)

### Experimental Stuff
- `zap` – The Z# package manager and CDN

## Philosophy

- Minimalism isn’t about less code. It’s about **less *waste*.**
- The best code is the one that **respects the hardware**.
- If you can build it better, **build it.** Even if no one’s watching.
